	<p>^^ cycle through different famous first lines of novels</p>
	<p>Let's collaborate together to create the worlds first library of crowdsourced stories, diaries, lyrics, etc. There are no limits; any type of text content is acceptable. The voting process will highlight the most popular content so other users may add to it. If a story takes a complete different directions, that it completely encouraged! This is a experiment to see what comes out. Link specific content to your friends and share via social media/email/etc. Create your own private branches if you have a specific group  of people you would like to collaborate with. Use it as you see fit!</p>
	<h3>Above content should be on seperate intro page</h3>

		<p>With heavy hearts we put back out to sea and within a few days reached a land inhabited by the Cyclopes, huge and fearsome giants with one eye in the middle of their forehead. They do not plough or sow the earth for everything there grows by itself: wheat, barley, grapes and what you will. They never meet to discuss their common problems, and as for laws, the do not know what they are. They live apart, in caves high on the mountains, and each one concerns himself with his own affairs alone. They are completely indifferent towards their neighbors.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Beyond their harbour lies a lovely green island, empty of men but filled with wild goats which find rich grazing in its lush meadows. It has its own sheltered cove for ships, where you need no anchor-stones or hawsers but just beach your vessel as long as you like upon the shore and leave it till you feel like sailing off again. It's just a stone's throw from where the Cyclopes live, and yet they've never been across to it, nor anywhere else, for that matter, for they have no ships and do not like the sea</p>
